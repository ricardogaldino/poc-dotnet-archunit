# PoC: ArchUnit .NET (Architectural Unit Testing)

<p>
  "ArchUnitNET is a free, simple library for checking the architecture of C# code. It is the C# fork of ArchUnit Java for Java. ArchUnitNET can check dependencies between classes, members, interfaces, and more. This is done by analyzing C# bytecode and importing all classes into our C# code structure. The main focus of ArchUnitNET is to automatically test architecture and coding rules."
